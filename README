This contains the source of the TDD_Should_Be_Fun() Application @ http://sogyotdd.appspot.com
Actually, this contains version 2, version 1 is currently still the one that's online.

* Running Locally
To run it locally, install Python and the AppEngine SDK (see links to instructions below), 
download a version of the source and follow the usual instructions (see AppEngine site, link below)

* Contribute
To help developing, install GIT and have some editor ready (or use the same IDE setup as I do, see below),
Link your git installation to github and fork the code. Send me a pull request. (instructions on http://github.com)
There is a very high probability I will honor your request, as I like teamwork. :)

*Setup / Instructions
I have described the setup I use in this readme and some links to instructions here.

Python
You'll need the python interpreter, get it from http://python.org/download/ and install it
The AppEngine requires Python 2.5+, I'm using 2.6 myself and haven't found any issues. 
The AppEngine SDK does have issues with Python 2.7 though, so don't use it (yet)

AppEngine SDK
You'll need the AppEngine SDK. Get it from 
http://code.google.com/intl/nl-NL/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python
This is a great site to start, by the way, with a lot of examples and explanations on everything AppEngine and Python
I'm using the basis SDK setup, no extra libraries, except for gaeunit.py, which you will find included in the src dir.
Currently, I'm working on version 1.3.8 of the SDK, but haven't found any issues when working with the 1.3.5 version recently

IDE
Currently, I'm using the Helios Release of Eclipse for Javascript developers,
which is to be found here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-javascript-web-developers/heliossr1
and I am using it with PyDev installed from http://pydev.org/updates
Works fine for me, but I'm don't have a very strong preference (yet) in this field. IDLE should work fine too.

I haven't checked in any IDE project files, I suggest you don't either.
The main project is the src/ directory any way, which can be run by the Google App Engine Launcher

GIT
I'm using msysgit, which can be found here http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
Occasionally, I use TortoiseGit, which can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
I definitely do not use any IDE-integrated GIT tool, as I have had bad experiences with such tools (they assume too much)
