This will contain version 2 of the TDD_Should_Be_Fun() Application @ http://sogyotdd.appspot.com

I have described the setup I use to develop here (26-11-2010)

Python
You'll need the python interpreter, get it from http://python.org/download/ and install it
The AppEngine requires Python 2.5+, I'm using 2.6 myself and haven't found any issues.

AppEngine SDK
You'll need the AppEngine SDK. Get it from 
http://code.google.com/intl/nl-NL/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python
This is a great site to start, by the way, with a lot of examples and explanations on everything AppEngine and Python
I'm using the basis SDK setup, no extra libraries, except for gaeunit.py, which you will find included in the src dir.
Currently, I'm working on version 1.3.8 of the SDK, but haven't found any issues when working with the 1.3.5 version recently

IDE
Currently, I'm using the Helios Release of Eclipse for Javascript developers,
which is to be found here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-javascript-web-developers/heliossr1
and I am using it with PyDev installed from http://pydev.org/updates
Works fine for me, but I'm don't have a very strong preference (yet) in this field. IDLE should work fine too.

I haven't checked in any IDE project files, I suggest you don't either.
The main project is the src/ directory any way, which can be run by the Google App Engine Launcher

GIT
I'm using msysgit, which can be found here http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
Occasionally, I use TortoiseGit, which can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/

I definitely do not use any IDE-integrated GIT tool, as I have bad experiences with such tools (they assume too much)
